### For this project we used the following libraries:
**Sweet alert:** For the different notifications provided to the user in its navigation.
**MaterialUI:** For the general design of the App. It was chosen for being one of the most used and being extensively documented officially and by its users.
**Firebase:** For the deployment and backend of the app, since it provides the possibility of running a data storage module and a backend server.
**React-router-dom:** For the navigation of the App and the linking between the different components.
